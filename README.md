# Unchained | a Blogging platform

The deployed app can be found [here](http://unchainedblog.herokuapp.com)

## Using the Site

You'll probably want to make a blog post, right?
Easy.
Sign up (email/Facebook/Google all catered for) and hit the new post link.
You'll be taken away to a wonderful page where you can write down all your thoughts
and concerns about this awful world we live in. You can even add an Image.
And did I mention Emojis? Oh yes. Emojis as well.
Go wild, let out all you angst then when you are ready hit the publish post button and It will be saved and posted on the site.
If you aren't ready, well don't worry! Save it as a draft and come back later. Nobody will be able to see your half-written posts but you. If you decide later on that your post was in fact too ridiculous, even for the internet, you can delete it or edit it, no sweat.

Once uploaded you can share your posts and even your profile on social media using the links.
If you see a post you like you can leave comments, and don't worry, if you make a post that has unpleasant comments you can remove them yourself.
If you visit your profile page, you'll be able to view all your own posts. Want to add a profile pic? No problem, go to the edit profile link in the same drop down menu you can add a profile pic, a short bio and where you currently live.
