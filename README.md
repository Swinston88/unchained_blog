## Using the Site

On visiting the web page you'll be greeted by a big green banner with a menu button on the right side.
Hover over it and choose your preferred log in, Facebook, Google+ or good old fashioned email sign up.

You'll probably want to make a blog post, right?
Easy.
Once your logged in hover back over that same menu button and hit the new post link.
You'll be taken away to a wonderful page where you can write down all your thoughts
and concerns about this awful world we live in. You can even add an Image.
And did I mention Emojis? Oh yes. Emojis as well.
Go wild, let out all you angst then when you are ready hit the publish post button and It will be saved and posted on the site.
If you aren't ready, well don't worry! Save it as a draft and come back later. Nobody will be able to see your half-written posts but you. If you decide later on that your post was in fact too ridiculous, even for the internet, you can delete it or edit it, no sweat.

Once uploaded you can share your posts and even your profile on social media using the links.
If you see a post you like you can leave comments, and don't worry, if you make a post that has unpleasant comments you can remove them yourself.
If you visit your profile page (The same drop down menu as before) you'll be able to view all your own posts. Want to add a profile pic. No problem, go to the edit profile link in the same drop down menu you can add a profile pic, a short bio and where you currently live.
